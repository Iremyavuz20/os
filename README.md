# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator

This project is a CPU scheduling simulator developed for the course **CENG 301 – Operating Systems**.

The simulator implements and compares the following scheduling algorithms:

- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)
- Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)
